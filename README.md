## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/gg-bni-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/gg-bni-app.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd gg-bni-app
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```
4.  **Set up Firebase Configuration:**
    - Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Enable **Firestore Database** and **Firebase Authentication** (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In).
    - Go to Project Settings -> Your apps -> Web (the `</>` icon) to get your Firebase configuration.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration variables. Example:
      ```dotenv
      VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
      VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
      VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
      VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
      VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
      VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
      VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID # Optional, if using Analytics
      ```
    - _Ensure these variables are correctly loaded in your React app (Vite prefixes `VITE_` for client-side environment variables).\_

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can interact with the application through your web browser.

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

    This will typically open your application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port).

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

3.  **Initial Setup / Login:**
    - If you have Firebase Authentication configured, you'll likely be prompted to sign up or log in.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to create an account or use existing credentials.
    - _Describe any initial steps a user might need to take, like adding their first products or setting up business details._
